# Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview of Analysis

The purpose of this project is to assess the differences between different supervised machine learning techniques and determine which strategy yields the best results.

## Results of Analysis

For our analysis, we used six different machine learning techniques. The pros and cons of which will be discussed below.

- **Naive Random Oversampling**



- **SMOTE Oversampling**

- **Clustered Centroids Undersampling**

- **SMOTEEN Combination Sampling**

- **Balanced Random Forest Classifier**

- **Easy Ensemble Adaptive Boost Classifier**
